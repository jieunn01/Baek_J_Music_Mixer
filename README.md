### Inspiration

This is an original reference for the music mixer [Incredibox](https://www.incredibox.com/demo/ "incredibox.com")

I also took inspiration from MUJI CD player and headset from BEATS. Both were looking good together for the decoration on the wall. Beige color and clean stuff are some of the concepts of this website. So that background would be great if it light brown woody wall. Also, add cd images into the cd player called 'music mixer' for easier understanding.
